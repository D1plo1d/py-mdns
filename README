py-mdns
  - Simple python api for common zeroconf mdns operations.

Current Status:
  - Publisher is working, however needs work.
  - Resolver is broken, and needs attention.

Project Goals:
  - Will initially be based from avahi api. Should
    interface what we can to allow for future Bonjour impl.
  - Mostly does mdns publish & lookup.
  - Should be able to resolve a single host name, or a group of names
    (tied to a dbus service).
  - Should hide dbus and avahi calls as much as possible.
  - Should present a simple API interface to downstream callers.
  - Should allow for configurable wait time (if possible) while
    looking up a host.
  - Should not be directly tied to a GUI API.
  - API should return multiple lookup in a set or array.
  - API should allow for some basic filtering of records based upon
    common use cases of lookup.
