Pure-Python interface to Apple Bonjour and compatible DNS-SD libraries

mdns provides a pure-Python interface to DNS-SD libraries such as
Apple Bonjour and Avahi.  It allows consuming Python programs to
take advantage of compliant Zero Configuration Networking (Zeroconf)
to register, discover, and resolve service on both local and wide-area
networks.

In the sprit of zero configuration, this Python mdns module is relies
on the underlying operating system to provide natural support for
DNS-SD operations.  For example; when using this module on a machine
which runs Linux, the Avahi backend will be used.  When using this
module on a machine using Mac OS X, the Apple Bonjour backend will
be used via Christopher Stawarz's pybonjour python module.

This design decision was born from the idea of providing a quick and
easy mechanism which can be hooked to operating system services (such
as those found in Linux under /etc/init.d).  These services once active
would optionally export DNS-SD information to the local vlan.

Additionally providing a neutral DNS abstraction in front of Avahi and
Bonjour serves to protect downstream applications and scripts from
changing specifications as DNS-SD becomes more mainstream and makes its
way through the IETF.
